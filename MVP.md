Findings:
Decision Tree or Random Forest are the best classification models.

Current Roadblocks:
Feature Engineering hasnâ€™t seemed to increase the score of my model. Potentially because of multicollinearity.

Next Steps:
Resolve Feature Engineering issue.
Check and solve for imbalance target values.
